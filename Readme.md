The Asset (file) Manager app is made up of a static web frontend with lambda
functions serving the backend.

The user will land in the index.html and from there proceed to register. It
needs to register with a real l address since it will email a verification code
needed in to validate the account. After that, is taken to the asset-manager
page where it can upload, download or delete asset(files).
